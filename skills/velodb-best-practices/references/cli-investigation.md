## CLI-Based Query Investigation

Evidence-first runtime diagnosis using velocli. Collect profile, tablet, DDL, stats, EXPLAIN, or connection evidence before forming hypotheses. Do not jump to schema fixes.

---

### Binary Policy

- Primary command: `velocli`
- SelectDB command: `sdbcli` only when user explicitly works with SelectDB
- Detection order:
  1. `VELOCLI_PATH` environment variable → use that binary path
  2. `command -v velocli` → use from PATH
  3. `command -v sdbcli` → only for SelectDB environments
  4. If none available: use fallback SQL (see end of this document)

### Safety Policy

- **Read-only evidence collection** may run proactively: `profile get`, `profile list`, `profile diff`, `profile history`, `tablet`, `auth status`, `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, `EXPLAIN`
- **Before executing user SQL with `--profile`**: check whether the SQL is safe (no DDL, no mutation, no unbounded scan without LIMIT). For unknown or potentially expensive SQL, run `EXPLAIN` first and ask the user to confirm or request an existing `query_id` instead
- **Never run** DDL, data mutations, cluster changes, or Cloud operations as part of diagnosis without explicit user confirmation
- Always use `--format json` for agent-readable output

### Evidence-First Hard Gate

- Do not present root causes, DDL rewrites, materialized views, index changes, bucket changes, or tuning recommendations until at least one evidence source has been collected or attempted
- Valid evidence sources: `profile get`, `profile diff`, `profile history`, `profile list --active`, `tablet`, `velocli sql "EXPLAIN ..."`, fallback SQL output, `auth status`, or an explicit user-provided profile/tablet/EXPLAIN snippet
- If a command cannot be executed locally because `velocli` or credentials are unavailable, say that evidence could not be collected here, then provide the exact commands for the user to run. Do not stop at "install velocli"
- If no evidence is available yet, the correct response is a short investigation plan plus the first read-only command to run, not a diagnosis
- After collecting evidence, report findings as hypotheses with confidence and caveats, not as guaranteed root causes

### Evidence Collection Workflows

**Prefer existing profiles over re-executing SQL.** Real support workflows usually start with a query_id, a complaint about a known slow query, or output from monitoring. Re-executing expensive SQL wastes resources and may not reproduce the original conditions.

#### Investigation ladder

Use the most specific available path:

1. User provides `query_id` → `profile get`
2. User provides slow-vs-fast query IDs → `profile diff`
3. User says query is running → `profile list --active`
4. User provides SQL but no `query_id` → `profile list`, then `EXPLAIN`, then optional confirmed `sql --profile`
5. User provides only a vague symptom → `auth status`, `profile list --active`, `profile list --limit 20`, then ask for SQL/query_id if nothing relevant appears
6. No CLI available → use fallback SQL or provide exact command plan; do not diagnose without evidence

#### When user provides a query_id

1. `velocli profile get <query_id> --format json`
2. If profile fetch fails, still treat the failed fetch as evidence. Check whether the failure looks like eviction, wrong HTTP port, or connectivity; see Failure Handling below
3. For each table in `scanned_tables`, run `velocli tablet <db.table> --detail --format json`
4. If `tablet` shows stale stats (zero rows on a known-populated table), note this as a caveat — metadata can lag on new or tiny tables
5. Gather evidence, form hypotheses, recommend next checks

#### When user provides SQL but no query_id

1. Check recent runs first: `velocli profile list --format json` — scan for matching SQL text
2. If a recent run exists, use that profile instead of re-executing
3. If no recent run exists, run `velocli sql "EXPLAIN <query>" --format json`
4. If SQL looks expensive, unfamiliar, during peak hours, or could scan/join large tables, show the EXPLAIN evidence and ask before profiled execution
5. Only after the safety gate passes: `velocli sql "<query>" --profile --format json`
6. Extract `query_id` from response → continue with profile workflow above

#### When user gives only a vague symptom

1. `velocli auth status --format json` — verify MySQL and HTTP connectivity before query diagnosis
2. `velocli profile list --active --format json` — look for currently slow/running queries
3. `velocli profile list --limit 20 --format json` — look for recent slow profiles
4. If the user gives a workload keyword but not exact SQL, optionally use `velocli profile history "<keyword>" --days 7 --format json`
5. If nothing relevant appears, ask for query_id, SQL text, dashboard/report name, time window, and environment. Do not invent a query or DDL

#### When investigating a running query

1. `velocli profile list --active --format json` — find active queries
2. Wait for completion or ask user if they want to cancel/let it finish
3. Then fetch the profile with `profile get`

#### Regression comparison

- `velocli profile diff <slow_qid> <fast_qid> --format json` — operator-by-operator delta
- Focus on operators where time or rows changed significantly

#### Trend analysis

- `velocli profile history "<sql_pattern>" --days 7 --format json` — p50/p99 over time
- Look for gradual growth (data volume) vs sudden jump (schema change, partition change, cluster change)

#### When profile is unavailable or was not enabled

1. Try `velocli profile list --limit 20 --format json` for recent profiles
2. Try `velocli profile history "<sql_pattern>" --days 7 --format json` if a query pattern is known
3. Use `velocli sql "EXPLAIN <query>" --format json` and `velocli tablet <db.table> --detail --format json` as fallback evidence
4. Ask to rerun with `--profile` only after the safety gate passes

### Diagnostic Hypotheses

Each mapping below is a **hypothesis**, not a guaranteed root cause. Present as: evidence observed → likely explanation → what to check next → possible fix → when this conclusion may be wrong.

#### High scan selectivity

- **Evidence**: scan operator `selectivity` >> 100, or `total_scan_rows` vastly exceeds output rows
- **Likely**: sort key does not match the query's primary filter columns — Doris scans more data than necessary
- **Check next**: `velocli tablet <table>` → compare `sort_key` columns with the query's WHERE clause. Also check if an inverted index or BloomFilter could help
- **Possible fix**: move the high-selectivity filter column to sort key position 1 → `schema-keys-selectivity-first`. Or add a secondary index
- **Not always this**: high selectivity can also result from stale column stats causing bad partition pruning, or from querying across many partitions where the filter is only selective within each partition

#### Tablet skew

- **Evidence**: `health.tablet_skew` > 3.0, or `tablet --detail` shows one backend holding most data
- **Likely**: bucket key has low cardinality or a skewed value distribution
- **Check next**: `SHOW COLUMN STATS <table>` to verify cardinality of the bucket key. Check if a dominant value (e.g., NULL, default) concentrates data
- **Possible fix**: switch to a higher-cardinality bucket key, use composite key, or switch to RANDOM (DUP tables only) → `schema-bucket-composite-for-skew`, `schema-bucket-high-cardinality-key`
- **Not always this**: skew can also be caused by uneven partition sizes, recent data loading into a subset of partitions, or a tablet migration in progress

#### Large shuffle on JOIN

- **Evidence**: `shuffle_bytes` is large on a JOIN operator, or `join_type` = shuffle for a table that could use broadcast or colocation
- **Likely**: tables are not colocated and the smaller side exceeds the broadcast threshold
- **Check next**: check both tables' bucket keys and counts with `velocli tablet`. Check dimension table size (< 1GB usually broadcasts automatically)
- **Possible fix**: for small dimensions (< 1GB), ensure broadcast join + runtime filter are working. For large repeated joins, align bucket keys and counts for colocation → `usecase-star-schema-join`
- **Not always this**: shuffle is sometimes correct for large-large joins. The cost may also be dominated by the scan, not the shuffle itself

#### Spill to disk

- **Evidence**: `spilled` = true on aggregation, sort, or join operators; `spilled_operators` > 0
- **Likely**: operator's intermediate state exceeds available memory — often caused by high-cardinality GROUP BY or large hash join build side
- **Check next**: identify which operator spills and check its `peak_mem_bytes` and input row count. Check `exec_mem_limit` session variable
- **Possible fix**: pre-aggregate with sync MV to reduce runtime cardinality (`schema-mv-sync-rollup`), increase `exec_mem_limit`, reduce `parallel_pipeline_task_num`, or use approximate aggregation (BITMAP for count distinct)
- **Not always this**: occasional spill on very large queries is expected behavior, not a bug. Only investigate if spill correlates with unacceptable latency

#### Cache miss on repeated queries

- **Evidence**: `cache_hit_pct` near 0 on queries that run repeatedly
- **Likely**: data is not cached — could be cold partition access, cache eviction, or query/partition cache disabled
- **Check next**: is the query hitting time partitions that were just loaded? Is file cache enabled (storage-compute mode)? Check `cache_last_version_interval_second`
- **Possible fix**: `schema-cache-file-cache`, `schema-cache-query-partition`
- **Not always this**: the first run after data ingestion always misses. If ingestion is continuous, cache may never warm fully for the latest partition

#### Planning overhead

- **Evidence**: `time_breakdown.plan` is a large fraction of `total_time_ms`
- **Likely**: too many partitions for the planner to evaluate, complex query with many joins, or Nereids optimizer overhead
- **Check next**: count partitions with `SHOW PARTITIONS FROM <table>`. Check `time_breakdown.nereids_rewrite` and `nereids_analysis` sub-phases
- **Possible fix**: reduce partition count (coarser granularity), add partition pruning predicates to WHERE clause, or use prepared statements for repeated queries
- **Not always this**: complex multi-table queries naturally take longer to plan. Only a problem if plan time dominates execution time

#### Blocked on upstream

- **Evidence**: downstream operator has `blocked_on_upstream` flag or wait time >> exec time
- **Likely**: the upstream operator (usually scan or shuffle) is the real bottleneck — the downstream operator is just waiting for data
- **Check next**: identify the upstream operator and diagnose that one instead
- **Possible fix**: fix the upstream issue (bad scan, slow shuffle, etc.) — the downstream wait will resolve automatically
- **Not always this**: network issues or cluster resource contention can also cause temporary blocking

### Failure Handling

#### Profile fetch fails

- Profile may be evicted (Doris keeps profiles for a limited time, often 5-15 minutes)
- HTTP port may be misconfigured: VeloDB Cloud uses 8080, self-hosted Doris uses 8030. `velocli auth status` shows `http_status` and `http_probe`
- FE may be unreachable: check the `served_by` and `fetch_attempts` fields in the error response
- **Recovery**: if profile is evicted, try `profile history` for trend data and `profile list` for nearby recent runs. Ask user to re-run with `--profile` only after the safety gate passes. If HTTP port is wrong, guide user to fix with `velocli auth add` (re-add environment with correct `--http-port`)

#### Tablet metadata lag

- Newly created or recently loaded tables may show `total_rows = 0` or stale sizes in `tablet` output
- This is normal — tablet metadata compaction and stats refresh have lag
- **Recovery**: note the caveat in your analysis. Use the profile's `total_scan_rows` as the actual row count signal instead of tablet metadata

#### Column stats unavailable

- `SHOW COLUMN STATS` may return empty if ANALYZE hasn't been run
- **Recovery**: note that cardinality estimates are unavailable. Recommend the user run `ANALYZE TABLE <table>` and revisit

#### Connection fails during investigation

- If `velocli auth status` shows `mysql_status: unreachable` or `http_status: unreachable`, diagnose the connection before continuing with query investigation
- For Cloud environments: cluster may be Suspended — check with `velocli cloud cluster get`
- For BYOC: may need SOCKS5 proxy

### Fallback SQL (When velocli is unavailable)

Use these via `mysql` client or any MySQL-compatible tool:

```sql
-- Table structure
SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table_name;

-- Query plan (pre-execution, does not run the query)
EXPLAIN <query>;

-- Tablet distribution and skew
SHOW DATA SKEW FROM db.table_name;

-- Column statistics (cardinality)
SHOW COLUMN STATS db.table_name;

-- Recent queries (requires FE access)
-- http://<fe_host>:<http_port>/rest/v2/manager/query/query_info
```

Limitations: no structured JSON, no `profile get` equivalent without HTTP API access, no `profile diff` or `profile history`. Analysis will be less precise — state this upfront.
